        </div>
        <p>The printer is certified in the U.S. to
conform to the requirements of DHHS 21 CFR, chapter 1 Subchapter
J for Class I(1) laser products, and elsewhere
is certified as a Class I laser product conforming to the requirements
of IEC 825.</p>
        <p>Class I laser products are not considered to be hazardous. The
laser system and printer are designed so there is never any human
access to laser radiation above a Class I level during normal operation, user
maintenance or prescribed service condition.</p>

        <p>The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 makes it unlawful
for any person to use a computer or other electronic device to send
any message via a telephone facsimile machine unless such message
clearly contains in a margin at the top or bottom of each transmitted
page or on the first page of the transmission the following information:</p>

        <p>The Telephone Company may make changes in its communications
facilities, equipment operations or procedures where such
action is reasonably required in the operation of its business and
is not inconsistent with the rules and regulations in FCC Part 68. If
such changes can be reasonably expected to render any customer terminal
equipment incompatible with telephone company communications facilities, or
require modification or alteration of such terminal equipment, or
otherwise materially affect its use or performance, the
customer shall be given adequate notice in writing, to
allow the customer an opportunity to maintain uninterrupted service.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The Ringer Equivalence Number and FCC Registration Number
for this machine may be found on the label located on the bottom
or rear of the machine. In some instances you may need
to provide these numbers to the telephone company.</p>
        <p>The Ringer Equivalence Number (REN) is a
measure of the electrical load placed on the telephone line, and
is useful for determining whether you have “overloaded” the
line. Installing several types of equipment on the same
telephone line may result in problems making and receiving telephone
calls, especially ringing when your line is called. The
sum of all Ringer Equivalence Numbers of the equipment on your telephone line
should be less than five in order to assure proper service from
the telephone company. In some cases, a sum of
five may not be usable on your line. If any of your telephone
equipment is not operating properly, you should immediately
remove it from your telephone line, as it may cause harm
to the telephone network.</p>
        <p>The equipment complies with Part 68 of the FCC rules and the
requirements adopted by the ACTA. On the rear of this equipment
is a label that contains, among other information, a
product identifier in the format US:AAAEQ##TXXXX. If
requested, this number must be provided to the telephone
company.</p>

          <p>The mains lead for this machine is fitted with a standard (BS

you change or examine the fuse, you must re-fit
the correct 13 amp fuse. You then need to replace the fuse
cover. If you have lost the fuse cover, do not
use the plug until you have another fuse cover. </p>
          <p>Contact the people from you purchased the machine.</p>
          <p>The 13 amp plug is the most widely used type in the UK and
should be suitable. However, some buildings (mainly
old ones) do not have normal 13 amp plug sockets. You
need to buy a suitable plug adaptor. Do not remove the
moulded plug.</p>
