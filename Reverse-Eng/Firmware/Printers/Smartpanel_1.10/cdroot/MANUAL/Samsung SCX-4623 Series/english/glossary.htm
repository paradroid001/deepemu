        <dd>
          <p>A computer graphics term describing the number of
bits used to represent the color of a single pixel in a bitmapped
image. Higher color depth gives a broader range of distinct
colors. As the number of bits increases, the number

and at the same time, a toner usage will be as much as
the coverage.</p>

duty cycle is 48,000 pages per month assuming 20 working
days, a printer limits 2,400 pages a day.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>Error Correction Mode (ECM) is
an optional transmission mode built into Class 1 fax machines or

in the fax transmission process that are sometimes caused by telephone
line noise.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Emulation</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Emulation is a technique of one machine obtaining
the same results as another.</p>
          <p>An emulator duplicates the functions of one system with a
different system, so that the second system behaves like
the first system. Emulation focuses on exact reproduction
of external behavior, which is in contrast to simulation, which
