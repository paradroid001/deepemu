"AppleTalk is a proprietary suite of protocols developed by Apple, Inc for computer networking. It was included in the original Macintosh (1984) and is now deprecated by Apple in favor of TCP/IP networking.",
"BIT Depth",
"A computer graphics term describing the number of bits used to represent the color of a single pixel in a bitmapped image. Higher color depth gives a broader range of distinct colors. As the number of bits increases, the number of possible colors becomes impractically large for a color map. 1-bit color is commonly called as monochrome or black and white.",

"A bitmapped graphics format used internally by the Microsoft Windows graphics subsystem (GDI), and used commonly as a simple graphics file format on that platform.",
"BOOTP",
"Bootstrap Protocol. A network protocol used by a network client to obtain its IP address automatically. This is usually done in the bootstrap process of computers or operating systems running on them. The BOOTP servers assign the IP address from a pool of addresses to each client. BOOTP enables 'diskless workstation' computers to obtain an IP address prior to loading any advanced operating system.",

"Charge Coupled Device (CCD) is a hardware which enables the scan job. CCD Locking mechanism is also used to hold the CCD module to prevent any damage when you move the machine.",

"A control panel is a flat, typically vertical, area where control or monitoring instruments are displayed. They are typically found in front of the machine. ",
"Coverage",
"It is the printing term used for a toner usage measurement on printing. For example, 5% coverage means that an A4 sided paper has about 5% image or text on it. So, if the paper or original has complicated images or lots of text on it, the coverage will be higher and at the same time, a toner usage will be as much as the coverage.",

The toner cartridge should remain in its original, unopened package until installation – If original packaging is not available, cover the top opening of the cartridge with paper and store in a dark cabinet.",

"Samsung Electronics does not recommend or approve the use of non-Samsung brand toner cartridges in your printer including generic, store brand, refilled, or remanufactured toner cartridges.",
"Samsung’s printer warranty does not cover damage to the machine caused by the use of a refilled, remanufactured, or non-Samsung brand toner cartridge.",
"Estimated cartridge life",
"Estimated cartridge life (the life of the toner cartridge yield) depends on the amount of toner that print jobs require. The actual print-out number may vary depending on the print density of the pages you print on, operating environment, printing interval, media type, and/or media size. For example, if you print a lot of graphics, the consumption of the toner is high and you may need to change the cartridge more often.",
"Tips for moving & storing your machine",
"When moving the machine, do not tilt or turn it upside down. Otherwise, the inside of the machine may be contaminated by toner, which can cause damage to the machine or bad print quality.",
